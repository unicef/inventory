Welcome to the UNICEF Open Source Inventory.
This is a UNICEF Mentor Toolkit about best practices, resources, and information about working and leading Open.
This is maintained as part of the [Open Source Mentorship programme]({{< ref "mentoring/overview" >}}) offered by the [UNICEF Venture Fund](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/).
The Inventory provides mentorship and guidance to anyone seeking to adopt best practices in their journey to building an Open Source project and community.
It is self-serve, and can be used at various phases of building a project and community.

The site content is organized into categories, shown below.
You can also search for specific content using the search bar on the home page (e.g. `licenses`).
Most learning resources are in the [_DPG Standard indicators_]({{< ref "dpg-indicators" >}}) category.
These learning resources are structured around the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/).
The Digital Public Goods Alliance provides more information [about digital public goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/) on their website.
