{{< faq "Why does the UNICEF Open Source Inventory exist?" >}}
The UNICEF Open Source Inventory was originally created in July 2019 as a mentoring tool for UNICEF Venture Fund startup companies.
The website is a living collection of information about best practices for working in Free & Open Source products, projects, and communities.
It was created to help collect answers to questions brought by the startup companies as they set out to build a business model around their Open Source intellectual property.
Today, its scope expands with a focus on achieving the compliance of a digital solution with the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/).
Additionally, an ongoing collection of knowledge reduces the on-boarding burden for new mentors who join the UNICEF Venture Fund.

However, this information is not only useful to UNICEF Venture Fund startup companies.
Several articles in this site feature contributions from external authors.
So, this site is created and shared in an Open Source format in order to build a community of practice around best practices.

{{< faq "What is the UNICEF Venture Fund?" >}}
The [UNICEF Venture Fund](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/) invests in early stage, Open Source, emerging technology digital public goods with the potential to impact children on a global scale.
It also provides product and technology assistance, support with business growth, and [access to a network of experts and partners](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/spurring-new-digital-public-goods) to allow for scale and growth.
Our ambition is to build successful digital solutions into Global [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/), to ensure fair, equitable, and open access to these unique and new tools for human development on a global scale.

The UNICEF Venture Fund is the first financial vehicle of its kind in the United Nations and enables UNICEF to learn from and to shape markets of emerging technology that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion persons’ needs.
Founded in 2016, the core motivation of the Venture Fund is to identify "clusters" or portfolios of initiatives around emerging technology - so that UNICEF can both shape markets and also learn about and guide these technologies to benefit children.
We invest in digital public goods that can impact the lives of vulnerable populations.

{{< faq "What are Digital Public Goods?" >}}
[Digital public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_public_goods) are Open Source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This definition is operationalised through the DPG Standard, a set of nine indicators that is used to determine whether a solution is a digital public good.
Once a solution is recognised as a digital public good, it is discoverable on the DPG Registry.

Open Source refers to something, historically software, that people can modify, share and re-use because its design or “source code” is made publicly accessible.
Open Source products provide universal access through an Open Source license that legally enables it.
In order for something to be recognised as a digital public good, solutions must demonstrate use of an approved Open Source license.
