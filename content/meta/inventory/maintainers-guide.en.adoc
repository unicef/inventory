This document is a maintainer's guide for the UNICEF Open Source Inventory.
Yes, this very site!
This guide covers key information and helpful resources, as well as best practices when maintaining the O.S. Inventory.


[[conventions]]
== Contribution conventions

This section explains contribution conventions for the Open Source Inventory.
These are common conventions that all contributors are asked to make when contributing to this repository.
Please make a best effort to follow these conventions at all times, unless there is a justified reason to break convention.

[[conventions-labels]]
=== Label conventions

All issue and pull request labels belong to one of the meta-categories of labels below:

. *_C_ omponent*:
  Used for indicating what component, or part, of the applications is related.
  In a large project, there are different kinds of components that exist together in a repository.
  The UNICEF Open Source Inventory includes content management, front-end code, and back-end code.
  Usually indicates what kind of maintainer is needed to move forward.
. *_I_ nclusion*:
  Used for community inclusion topics.
  Issues or pull requests tagged with inclusion labels typically impact the contribution workflow and other people working on the project.
. *_T_ ype*:
  What types of issues and pull requests do we get?
  These labels indicate whether something _new_ is added or if improvements are made to existing components.
. *_X_*:
  Used for close statuses.
  These labels are only used on closed issues and pull requests.
. *_?_*:
  Used for labels that require more information.
  Usually indicates experienced maintainer action is required to move forward.

[[conventions-commits]]
=== Commit message conventions

. *Prefix your commit message with the component you are changing, and optionally, an emoji*.
  If you are editing a page in the _Project Management_ category, start your commit message with `Project Management:`.
  If you are changing Hugo configurations, archetypes, or other tweaks, start your commit with message with `hugo:`.
  And so on.
  Optionally, you may add a https://gist.github.com/ricealexander/ae8b8cddc3939d6ba212f953701f53e6[GitHub emoji] to your commit message summary line that best represents your change.
. *All commit messages on the `main` branch should be https://medium.com/compass-true-north/writing-good-commit-messages-fc33af9d6321[good commit messages]*.
. *Avoid merge commits*.
  Preserve good commit messages by rebase merging, or if commit messages are not helpful in aggregate, use squash merging.
  Do not allow merge commits.

[[conventions-submodule]]
=== How to update git submodule as a maintainer

There are two components to this Hugo website:
*content repository* (https://github.com/unicef/inventory[unicef/inventory]) and *theme repository* (https://github.com/unicef/inventory-hugo-theme[unicef/inventory-hugo-theme]).

The content repository hosts all of the written information published in the O.S. Inventory.
The theme repository hosts the front-end design and Hugo templates used in the O.S. Inventory.
The content repository clones the theme repository as a *git submodule* to the `themes/inventory/` path.
Therefore, whenever changes are made to the upstream theme repository, the git submodule for the theme repository needs to be updated.
The git submodule must be updated from the content repository.

[[conventions-submodule-example]]
==== Example: git in command line

The shell commands below were tested with the git command line client, version 2.31 or later:

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=8 15-17,linenostart=1" >}}
git submodule update --remote --rebase
cd themes/inventory/
git fetch
git checkout <latest commit hash>
cd ../../
git add themes/inventory
git commit --signoff
{{< / highlight >}}

[[conventions-priorities]]
=== How development decisions are prioritized

Development decisions are prioritized according to the needs of the following stakeholders:

. UNICEF Office of Innovation staff and consultants
. UNICEF Innovation Fund grantees and portfolio companies
. UNICEF colleagues
. UN colleagues
. Open Source practitioners and subject-matter experts (e.g. associated to a private-sector Open Source Program Office)
. General public

For as long as this list does not generate conflict, this is sufficient to guide development decisions by meeting the needs of key stakeholders.
Over time, if this list creates friction, this part of the maintainer's guide should be revisited.
