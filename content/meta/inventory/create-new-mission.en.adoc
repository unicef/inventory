title: Build a rocketship <1>
description: Embark on a new mission to build your first rocketship to Mars. <2>

<1> `title` is a noun in plural form. It clearly defines what the Mission topic is.
<2> `description` is one, at most two, sentences to describe the Mission topic.
<3> `categories` is a single value and must always be set to `missions` for a new Mission.
<4> `tags` is a descriptive list of words to describe key elements of the Mission. Check other Missions to see tags already in use.
