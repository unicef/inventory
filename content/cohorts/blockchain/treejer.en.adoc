Treejer (trēʒər) is an open protocol connecting funders to rural planters worldwide.
The project is experimenting with cutting-edge concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts to unlock new opportunities for climate finance, rural development and carbon credits.
The team has on-boarded planters from over 10 countries located in the Latin America, Africa and Middle East.
Users are enabled to make ecological and social impact even in unbanked communities.

The protocol consists of several smart contracts and two main interfaces linked to them:

[[web]]
== Web Interface

Using Treejer's web interface, users can start a forest and add trees.
They see a track the forest status and get updates from planters.
The interface allows to send tree gifts to others.

Each tree is represented by a clean NFT on Polygon network (Ethereum's sidechain) and is traceable by design.
Real-life and on-chain attributes of the trees are accessible to everyone.
Trees are individually profiled and each one has its own unique attributes, similar to collectibles.
The team aims to make climate finance more fun for users.


[[app]]
== Mobile App

Rural planters use a dedicated mobile application to join Treejer, submit trees, update their status and receive rewards.
