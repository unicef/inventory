*A tech-powered assistive technology company working to enhance access to digital services.*

The core services of the I-Stem portal are content conversion of difficult format types (documents and audio/video) into accessible formats for people with print disabilities and those who are deaf or hard of hearing using advances in AI, besides providing tech-powered mentorship and inclusive hiring solutions.
This not only helps institutes and organizations that currently use manual processes for accessibility conversion save up to 70% in accessibility conversion cost and meet their legal compliance, but also enhances access to information and opportunities for people with disabilities.

The I-Stem portal provides document accessibility services (the conversion of inaccessible documents including documents with complex layouts, math etc. into accessible formats for people with print disabilities), audio/video accessibility services (high-quality captioning including the ability to train custom models for domain-specific terminology and visual content extraction from videos) and community services (mentorship request and inclusive hiring/employer connect).
There are currently nearly 500 individuals with disabilities on the platform and pilots with two academic institutes are ongoing.
