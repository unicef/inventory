*link:http://www.propter.rs/[Propter D.O.O] are developing ScioXR, a VR/AR software platform that delivers immersive learning games and experiences that empower students to learn about the world around them.*

Technology around us has gone a long way since the beginning of our millennium.
Yet, most of our classrooms remain more or less the same as they were at the end of the 20th century.
This especially applies to the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) field.
Propter seeks to modernize the contemporary classroom and spark the studentâ€™s interest for new technologies and prepare them for the 21st century job market.
This is done by engaging students as early as possible in the real-world STEM ecosystem.
For students to fully grasp applications of the knowledge they are acquiring, we need to provide them with problems whose context they can experience and relate to.
ScioXR seeks to address this problem and solve it by introducing the latest achievements in VR/AR technology into the modern classroom.
