---

This page is a reading list of resources about project management, product development, and community management.
It is a catch-all reading list for anything related to supporting the humans behind the Open Source projects.
While there are many resources on these topics around the web, this reading list focuses specifically on an Open Source perspective.
If you are familiar with the role of a developer advocate, there is some overlap between the responsibilities of that type of position.
