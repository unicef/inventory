      <description>A tech-powered assistive technology company working to enhance access to digital services.
 The core services of the I-Stem portal are content conversion of difficult format types (documents and audio/video) into accessible formats for people with print disabilities and those who are deaf or hard of hearing using advances in AI, besides providing tech-powered mentorship and inclusive hiring solutions. This not only helps institutes and organizations that currently use manual processes for accessibility conversion save up to 70% in accessibility conversion cost and meet their legal compliance, but also enhances access to information and opportunities for people with disabilities.</description>
